# Flask-Multipass-CERN

This package provides the ``cern`` auth and identity providers for [Flask-Multipass][multipass].

These providers are only useful if you are at CERN and intend to use Flask-Multipass
with the new Keycloak-based CERN authentication infrastructure.

## Note

In applying the MIT license, CERN does not waive the privileges and immunities granted to it
by virtue of its status as an Intergovernmental Organization or submit itself to any jurisdiction.
